# Hangman

### Introduction

This is a very simple game...a game in which the user has to fill in the blanks given to generate a specific word in a limited number of trials.

### How to Play

* Open a terminal and move to this directory.

* To run the game GUI:
```
python3 Hangman_gui.py
```
* Strategy -> Start by spelling the vowels first...they are almost indispensible in every word...and can help in guessing the given word.

### Code

#### Hangman.py

* Contains the core functionalities of the Hangman Game.
* We can run the terminal version of the game using this script.

#### Hangman_gui.py

* The script takes the functionalities from Hangman.py and generates a GUI using pygame library. The GUI has to be worked out upon...to increase its overall look...but as of now...it is working correctly.
