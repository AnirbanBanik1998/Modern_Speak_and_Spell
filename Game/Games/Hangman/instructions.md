# Hangman

### Introduction

This is a very simple game...a game in which the user has to fill in the blanks given to generate a specific word in a limited number of trials.

### How to Play

* Open a terminal and move to this directory.
* Run the entire process:
```
python3 Hangman.py
```
* Strategy -> Start by spelling the vowels first...they are almost indispensible in every word...and can help in guessing the given word.
