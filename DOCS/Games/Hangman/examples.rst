Examples
=========

This basic example is mainly to show how to play the game.
Suppose the word is "ANIRBAN"

.. list-table:: STEPS:
   :widths: 25 25 50 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - INPUT
     - OUTPUT
     - REASON
   * - A
     - A----A-
     - A is there two times
   * - B
     - A---BA-
     - B is there one time
   * - C
     - A---BA-
     - C is not present there
   * - I
     - A-I-BA-
     - I is there one time
   * - N
     - ANI-BAN
     - N is there two times
   * - R
     - ANIRBAN
     - R is there one time

Strategy -> Start by spelling the vowels first...they are almost indispensible in every word...and can help in guessing the given word.
