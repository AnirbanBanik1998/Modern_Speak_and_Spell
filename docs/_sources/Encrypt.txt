Encrypter
==========

This is a game in which the user will be given three choices.
1.Encode
2.Decode
3.Guess

In the first two games the user will be given to encode or decode some words based on a hint provided. In the third game, the user has to guess the actual word from the encrypted one using some shift operations.
