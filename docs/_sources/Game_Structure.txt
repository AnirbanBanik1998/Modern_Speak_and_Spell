Design of the game structure
============================

The positions of the words in the rows and columns can be 1-3 and 2-4 respectively, and words are designed to be fitted in the crossword alternately, means if a word is at the first row, then the next word will be at the third row, and same logic for the columns. 

The matrix is displayed according to the following logic. |#| for the blank cells, and |A| for the cell with letter A.

The 4-letter words have been scraped out of the wordlist. Then using PyDictionary, it's meanings, in noun, verb, adjective, and adverb forms have been formed, and combined list is in words.csv.

The game has been designed to give the user a hint, by displaying the meaning of the word, before he guesses the word.
