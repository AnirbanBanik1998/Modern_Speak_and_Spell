The basic examples are mainly to show how to play the game.

A Note on the Caeser Cipher
----------------------------

This is a very simple cipher used in encryptions in which the letters are shifted each by a specific value.

Let us for example shift "ABXY" by 4:

A -> E, B -> F, X -> B, Y -> C, the encrypted word is "EFBC".


Encode
^^^^^^
The game is basically to encrypt a given word.

Suppose "anirban" is encrypted as "bojscbo", so the shifting key is +1.
Therefore suppose we have been given to encrypt "google", so the encryption will be "hpphmf".
We just have to guess the encrypted word and spell it properly within 20 trials.

Decode
^^^^^^
This game is basically to decrypt a given encoded word.

Suppose "cpktdcp" is decoded as "anirban", the shifting key for decoding is -2.
Therefore suppose we have been given to decode "eqy", the answer will be "cow".
Just guess the word, and spell it out within 20 trials.

Guess
^^^^^
This is a rather interesting game, here we have to guess the shifting key.
We will be provided the encoded word, the original word, and just guess the shifting key.
Suppose the words given are "anirban" and "cpktdcp", the shifting key for encoding is 2.
So just enter the correct shifting key within 10 trials.
